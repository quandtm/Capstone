Capstone
========

This project contains the source code for a proof of concept editor that implements the techniques described in my capstone research project.

The focus of this project was on utilising gameplay design elements within game content creation tools such as level editors.

In particular it looks at the use of an objective based tutorial system, and a road/zone system (like SimCity) to rapidly create content.

This is purely for research/educational purposes and as such no warranties or support are provided.
